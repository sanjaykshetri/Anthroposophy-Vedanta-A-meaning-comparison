The Philosophy of Freedom and Spiritual Science

By Rudolf Steiner

The human being stands between two worlds. Through the physical senses, we perceive 
the material world around us. But there exists also a supersensible world, accessible 
through spiritual perception and clairvoyance.

The ego, or I-consciousness, is the foundation of human individuality. It is through 
the ego that we develop self-awareness and the capacity for freedom. The etheric body 
carries the life forces, while the astral body bears our emotions and desires.

Through spiritual science, we can investigate these higher realms scientifically. 
The path of initiation leads to higher knowledge. Ancient wisdom traditions, including 
the teachings found in the Bhagavad Gita and the Vedanta philosophy, recognized similar 
truths about the nature of consciousness and the spiritual world.

The concept of karma and reincarnation are fundamental to understanding human destiny. 
Like the Eastern teachings of samsara and moksha, we recognize that the soul evolves 
through successive earthly lives. The higher self guides this evolution.

The forces of Lucifer represent pride and spiritual isolation, while Ahriman embodies 
materialism and denial of spirit. Against these forces stands the Christ impulse, 
bringing love and unity.

Just as the Upanishads speak of Atman and Brahman, we speak of the divine spark within 
each individual and its connection to the cosmic whole. The path of yoga in Eastern 
tradition parallels our path of spiritual development through knowledge and devotion.

The supersensible worlds include the astral plane and higher spiritual realms. Through 
meditation and inner development, one can achieve states similar to samadhi, experiencing 
consciousness beyond the ordinary waking state.

Ancient Indian wisdom, particularly the teachings of Krishna in the Gita, shares much 
with anthroposophical understanding. The concept of dharma resonates with our understanding 
of cosmic order and human purpose.
