The Bhagavad Gita: The Song of the Blessed One

Translation and Commentary

Chapter 2: The Yoga of Knowledge

Arjuna, the great warrior, stood upon the battlefield of Kurukshetra, filled with 
sorrow at the prospect of war. Lord Krishna, his charioteer and divine teacher, 
spoke these immortal words:

"You grieve for those who should not be grieved for. The wise grieve neither for 
the living nor for the dead. The Atman, the true Self, is never born and never 
dies. It is eternal, unchanging, and indestructible."

"As a person casts off worn-out garments and puts on new ones, so does the Atman 
cast off worn-out bodies and enter into new ones. This is the truth of reincarnation, 
the cycle of birth and death known as samsara."

"The wise understand that the body is temporary, but the Atman is eternal. Know 
that Brahman, the Supreme Reality, pervades all existence. That which is real 
cannot cease to be; that which is unreal never comes into being."

"Perform your dharma, your righteous duty, without attachment to the fruits of 
action. This is Karma Yoga, the path of selfless action. Whether in pleasure or 
pain, gain or loss, victory or defeat, remain equanimous."

Chapter 6: The Yoga of Meditation

"Through yoga, the practice of meditation and self-discipline, one attains union 
with the Divine. The yogi whose mind is controlled, who has conquered the senses, 
attains the supreme state of samadhi, absorption in Brahman."

"In that state of consciousness, one realizes the truth: Tat Tvam Asi - That Thou 
Art. The Atman and Brahman are one. The individual soul realizes its identity with 
the universal consciousness."

Chapter 9: The Yoga of Devotion

"Through bhakti, devotion and love, one can reach the highest truth. I am the source 
of all creation. The wise, understanding this, worship Me with their whole being."

"Abandoning all dharmas, all duties and practices, take refuge in Me alone. I shall 
liberate you from all sins and grant you moksha, liberation from the cycle of rebirth."

The Path to Self-Realization

The Gita teaches three primary paths: Jnana Yoga (the path of knowledge), Karma Yoga 
(the path of action), and Bhakti Yoga (the path of devotion). Through any of these 
paths, with proper understanding and practice, one can attain moksha.

The state of liberation is characterized by freedom from maya, the illusion that 
binds us to the material world. One experiences sat-chit-ananda: being, consciousness, 
and bliss. This is the fourth state, turiya, beyond waking, dreaming, and deep sleep.

The Upanishads, ancient wisdom texts, further elaborate on these teachings. They 
declare: Aham Brahmasmi - I am Brahman. The recognition of one's true nature as 
infinite consciousness is the goal of all spiritual practice.

Through meditation on Om, the sacred sound, and through the practice of Raja Yoga, 
one purifies the mind and awakens the inner light. The three gunas - sattva (purity), 
rajas (activity), and tamas (inertia) - must be transcended.

This wisdom, passed down through the ages by sages like Vyasa and later expounded 
by great teachers like Adi Shankara, forms the foundation of Advaita Vedanta, the 
philosophy of non-dualism.
